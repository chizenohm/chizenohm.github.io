<p>Our stepping stone into this infinite world is understanding geometric transformations using Pascal&#8217;s triangle. Constructing Pascal&#8217;s triangle is simple&#8212;&#8203;starting with a seed value of <code>{1}</code>, every element of the triangle is the sum of the two values directly above it (we can add imaginary zeroes at the edges). The following animation should help you grasp the concept of Pascal&#8217;s triangle.</p>

<p>Rather than keeping concepts abstract, we can represent Pascal&#8217;s triangle in computer code. In this post we will be using Haskell, which is a typed purely functional programming language with call by need semantics. That may sound like a lot of technical jargon, but essentially Haskell is well suited to this problem.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_generating_pascals_triangle">Generating Pascal&#8217;s triangle</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin, let&#8217;s generate Pascal&#8217;s triangle. Our goal is to generate a list of rows of Pascal&#8217;s triangle, where each row contains numbers. We could tackle this problem directly, but as a good engineer we value composability&#8212;&#8203;the ability to build small reusable components which can be combined to solve a larger problem. In our case, we would like to be able to generate one row of the triangle given the row&#8217;s predecessor&#8212;&#8203;we call this function <code>pascalStep</code>. Once we have our <code>pascalStep</code> function, the entire triangle can be evaluated by repeated applications of this function on the starting seed of <code>{1}</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how exactly does <code>pascalStep</code> work? Well, we know that it takes a list of numbers as its argument, and adds adjacent elements in this list together. This can be viewed using geometric transformations. First we duplicate the row, then shift the duplicate row by one position to the right, add zeroes on the ends as appropriate, and perform column-wise addition. The following visual should help you understand this better.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="pascalStep.png" alt="pascalStep">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Haskell code for our <code>pascalStep</code> function is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">pascalStep xs = zipWith (+) (cons 0 xs) (snoc xs 0)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equipped with the <code>pascalStep</code> function, we need a function that repeatedly applies this function to our starting seed. This function is called <code>iterate</code> in Haskell, which works as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">iterate f xs = [ x, f x, f (f x), f (f (f x)), ...]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus the code generating Pascal&#8217;s triangle can be concisely written in the following manner:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">pascalTriangle = iterate pascalStep [1]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could turn the <code>pascalTriangle</code> function into a one liner if we wanted to, but we value composability, so we resist the temptation.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">oneLiner = iterate (zipWith (+) (cons 0 xs) (snoc xs 0)) [1]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if Pascal&#8217;s triangle wasn&#8217;t very interesting, this post would end here. However, that&#8217;s clearly not the case. Pascal&#8217;s triangle was actually known to ancient mathematicians long before Blaise Pascal. In India, it was known as the staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it was the Khayyam triangle. And in China, it was called Yang Hui&#8217;s triangle. Today, the triangle is named after Pascal for his contributions in recognizing the patterns it contains.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at an interesting pattern. The sum of the diagonals of the Pascal&#8217;s triangle yield the Fibonacci sequence. How does a mathematical sequence, where the ratio of consecutive terms asymptotically approach the golden ratio, show up in this triangle? In other words, how does the Fibonacci sequence appear in Pascal&#8217;s triangle? Since the Fibonacci sequence is embedded in Pascal&#8217;s triangle, does that mean there is a way to generate the Fibonacci sequence using our <code>pascalStep</code> function, similar to how we constructed Pascal&#8217;s triangle using the <code>pascalStep</code> function? We will know the answer in a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calculating the Fibonacci sequence is simple. The sequence starts with <code>1</code> and <code>1</code>, and every term after that is the sum of the previous two terms. If we were to naively implement a function that calculates the n&#8217;th Fibonacci number, we could write something like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">fibN 0 = 1
fibN 1 = 1
fibN n = fibN (n-1) + fibN (n-2)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, that only gives us the n&#8217;th Fibonacci number. Computing the entire list of Fibonacci numbers becomes an expensive computation with this approach. A computer scientist would generally propose dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity, but let us look at an alternative approach which generates the Fibonacci sequence with simple geometric transformations.</p>

<h2 id="_entering_the_couniverse">Entering the couniverse</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand how we can generate the fibonacci sequence via geometric transformations, we need to leave this universe, and move into the couniverse! Sounds crazy, but it will make sense in a bit. If somehow we could take the list of infinite Fibonacci numbers, duplicate this list, drop the first element in one copy, and add column-wise, we end up getting every third element of the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="fibsHaskell.png" alt="fibsHaskell">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So theoretically, if we prepended two 1&#8217;s to this list, we would get the Fibonacci sequence. The Haskell code for this technique is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) (tail fibs) fibs</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, although I said theoretically, it&#8217;s quite marvelous that this pseudocode we made up is actually valid Haskell code, and produces an efficient binary that also memoizes previous results. This is the magic of the couniverse! You can manipulate lists of infinite size in the couniverse, and you still end up with efficient implementations (sometimes more efficient than its dual counterpart in the universe).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although that&#8217;s quite elegant by itself, we want to see the relation between the Fibonacci sequence and Pascal&#8217;s triangle. There is some similarity that&#8217;s evident right away:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">pascalStep xs = zipWith (+) (cons 0 xs) (snoc xs 0)
fibs =  1 : 1 : zipWith (+) (tail fibs) fibs</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of <code>pascalStep</code>, we duplicate <code>xs</code>, and in the case of fibs we duplicate <code>fibs</code>. In both cases, we manipulate these copies, then add them together column-wise using <code>zipWith (+)</code>. But does the similarity stop there?</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_data_and_codata">Data and Codata</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand a deeper connection, we need to talk about data and codata. In our universe, we deal with data, that is, finite values. In the couniverse, we deal with codata, that is, infinite values. Properties of the universe may not hold in the couniverse, and vice versa. To understand this, let&#8217;s consider a partial function:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">unsafeHead [] = error "unsafeHead on empty list!"
unsafeHead (x:_) = x</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>unsafeHead</code> is unsafe because it returns an error when provided an empty list. But suppose we are dealing with codata, where the list being passed is infinite, then <code>unsafeHead</code> is actually safe!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s neat! Our unsafe functions become safe. But can things go the other way?</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell">sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking the sum of a list is a safe function when we deal with data (a finite list). However, computing the sum of a list when dealing with codata (an infinite list) is a non-terminating function!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This explains a crucial differentiating point about data and codata. They actually live in different domains, and functions may be safe/unsafe depending on the domain you&#8217;re working with. Haskell makes no distinction between data and codata, so the lines that distinguish them are blurred here.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that <code>pascalStep</code> acts on data, but the <code>zipWith (+)</code> in fibs acts on codata. When acting on codata, non-intuitive things happen, the same way weird things happen when dealing with infinite sets in mathematics. We know what happens when you add an element to the start of an infinite list - we get back what we expect. But what happens when we add an element to the end of an infinite list? The list remains unchanged!</p>

<p>This is counter-intuitive. The length of the new list remains the same, and the result is as if we did not do anything to the list to begin with! Using this fact, we can view our fibs functions with new light!</p>

<p>We replace <code>fibs</code> with <code>(snoc fibs 0)</code> by transforming:</p>

<p>Close! But <code>tail fibs</code> is not the same as <code>cons 0 xs</code>, or is it? Here is a non-trivial rewrite:</p>

<p>And now for the finale! The Fibonacci sequence is the least fixed point of the composition of the <code>pascalStep</code> function with a function that adds <code>1</code> to the start of the list.

<p>We can see that <code>cons 1 . pascalStep</code> does not yield the Fibonacci sequence, but rather converges to it. Instead of consistency, we have eventual consistency.</p>

<h3 id="_using_mathematical_jargon_helps_in_reasoning">Using mathematical jargon helps in reasoning</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the <code>fix</code> function tells us that the function may not be consistent, but is guaranteed to be eventually consistent. This is a lot more understandable compared to the implementation with primitive self recursion. It might seem counter intuitive at first, but the mathematical jargon pays off eventually.</p>

<h3 id="_equational_reasoning_applies_in_the_couniverse_but_with_a_catch">Equational reasoning applies in the couniverse, but with a catch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equational reasoning allows us to substitute freely knowing that there won&#8217;t be any unintended side-effects. This is exactly what we did when we started converting the <code>fibs</code> function to make use of <code>pascalStep</code>. But just like type isomorphisms in the universe, we have to be aware of term isomorphisms in the couniverse, such as the fact that adding an element to the end of an infinite list does not change the list.</p>

<h3 id="_composability_eventually_pays_off">Composability eventually pays off</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it was tempting to convert our Pascal triangle implementation into a one liner earlier, not doing so enable code reuse. In general, we should strive to have small blocks which are easy to reason about, and compose these blocks to solve the problem at hand. The fact that the <code>pascalStep</code> function could be reasoned about using geometric transformations helped in reusing the function for the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<h3 id="_think_different">Think different</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can&#8217;t solve our problems in the couniverse with the same mentality that we have in the universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall that <code>sum</code> and <code>unsafeHead</code> have different properties in different universes. Whether or not we could use them depends on the universe we are working in. In the same light, our software engineering principles are designed around our universe, and sometimes these principles may not apply to the couniverse. And this also means thinking about whether GHC understands the couniverse as well as we do.</p>

<p>So the Fibonacci sequence lives in the couniverse. This begs the question, does Pascal&#8217;s triangle also live in the couniverse? We could take an alternate approach by using a different starting seed.</p>

<p>This post is quite lengthy as it is, so I will stop here. But, looking at it again, why exactly does the non-trivial rewrite work? If you&#8217;re still curious, then you can prove:</p>
